===Introduction===

This little script provides an easy way of getting a formatted list of files in a directory and show their sizes (in kb).

===Details===

- written in Perl
- actually only runs on linux (using glob-statement)
- controlled by command line flags

===Usage===

As written above, "filelist" uses command line flags.
Possible ways to use it and corresponding outputs are:

- without flags: you will be prompted to enter the dir to scan, output on screen
- "-d [dir]": a file named "filelist.txt" will be created in your homedir, containing list of files in "[dir]"
- "-d [dir] -o": same as with "-d [dir]", but output will be given on screen
